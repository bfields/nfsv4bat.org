  <h1>Overview</h1>

    <li>When: October 17th - 21st</li>
    <li>Registration: Send me email - in particular, I need to know if you need to ship equipment to us.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Testing Focus</h1>

  <p>These are not meant to be inclusive, but reflect interests shown
     in the WG:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>pNFS and NFSv4.1</li>
    <li>NFSv4.2 prototypes</li>
    <li>NFSv4.0 Migrations</li>

  <h1>CDA</h1>

  <p>
    We may not need an CDA if you plan to attend a talk. If you plan to be on the testing floor,
    we need a CDA in place - just one per company. Please fill out the
    <a href="/Events/2011/October/BAT/NetApp_BAT_2011_CDA.pdf">CDA (pdf)</a>,
    sign it, scan it, and send me a copy.  You can also just bring it with you.
  </p>
  
  <h1>Talks</h1>

  <p>No talks are scheduled, but a small room has been reserved
     for breakout sessions.</p>

  <h1>Registration</h1>

   <p>What I need is the number of attendees from your company,
      their names (and email) for badging purposes, and the type of
      equipment you will be bringing.</p>

   <p>I'm primarily interested in if the equipment has special
      power requirements and if it is loud.</p>

   <p>If you are interested in reserving some UID, GID, and names in
      NIS/LDAP, please let me know.</p>

   <p>By the way, please look at the <a href="/Documents/Requirements/event_hosting.html">Event Hosting Requirements</a> and let me know if you plan to use
      a network service not listed.</p>

  <h1>Directions</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.netapp.com/us/contact-us/">Driving directions</a> to NetApp.</li>
    <li><a href="/Events/2011/October/BAT/netapp_campus.pdf">Campus Map</a> - look for Building 7.
      <ul>
        <li>You gain entry at the crook of the NE corner.</li>
        <li>You can park pretty much anywhere that doesn't warn you off.</li>
        <li>Beware as spots fill up early near Building 7.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Lodging</h1>

  <p>I can provide hints/recommendations, but there is no event hotel,
  i.e., no special rates.</p>
