	While NFS enjoys the ubiquity and interoperability of TCP/IP networking,
	it is facing a growing performance barrier inherent in the architecture
	of host networking stacks.  Clients and servers are unable to keep up
	with a "fire hose" of data.  RDMA provides direct data placement and
	network offload into hardware, decoupling network performance from host
	performance.  NFS can use RDMA to take full advantage of the performance
	benefits of multi-Gigabit Ethernet and Infiniband networks.  This
	presentation will describe RDMA, how NFS will use it, and how it will
	affect the balance of SAN vs NAS storage.

	Scaling NFS server throughput can be accomplished in
	several ways; most commonly NFS servers approach the
	challenge of scaling by devoting larger and larger
	machines to the task, which creates larger single points
	of failure.  An alternate approach to achieving
	scalability is using multiple servers in a cluster
	configuration.  This approach has not been widely
	adopted because of the challenge of maintaining cache
	coherency between the nodes.  Leveraging MPFS technology
	natively on EMC Celerra NFS servers allows you to build
	incrementally scalable amounts of front-end capacity to
	a shared filesystem.  This allows you to treat your NFS
	serving requirements much like you treat your storage
	requirements, scaling incrementally to meet your
	front-end I/O requirements.

	requirements (service level agreements, recoverability,
