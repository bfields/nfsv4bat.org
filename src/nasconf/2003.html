	A common challenge faced by customers
	today is handling filesharing within environments that are
	predominantly multi-protocol (heterogeneous environments).
	Traditionally file sharing environments provide access to files
	in a sharing capacity via NFS, CIFS or other filesystem
	protocol. This tutorial will expose the benefits of leveraging
	NAS in environments requiring access to the same data shared via
	multiple protocols (NFS and CIFS). Specifically, how to present
	the same data to network clients via NFS, CIFS and FTP, a
	variety of issues associated with maintaining proper security
	(including locking symantics) and managing the interaction
	between a UNIX and a Windows environment when deploying NAS in a

	Many companies have large data warehouse
	environments that require the use of many incoming data sources.
	These data sources are often combined together with extraction,
	transformation, and load (ETL) tools and then loaded into
	multiple databases for analysis. There is significant advantage
	to storing these processed data sets in a central location for
	use by multiple databases and for later retrieval in the event
	of a data quality problem such as corruption or schema change.
	This environment tends to be strenuous for NFS based systems due
	to a number of factors. These factors include high throughput
	performance requirements, large file sizes, and high numbers of
	shared file systems in a heterogeneous client and server
	environment.
	<br />
	I will discuss AOL's experience with these issues, how we deal
	with them, and what improvements we feel will help most with our

	As customers RDBMSs
	continue to grow, their storage subsystem complexity also
	continues to grow. New technologies are created to address these
	issues, however data manageability is still the number one issue
	customers continue to face today. Storage virtualization via
	file based Network Attached Storage protocols have been
	addressing this issue head on. While utilizing existing
	infrastructure, tried and true tools/diagnostic facilities, and
	additional feature sets such as end-to-end data security and
	Quality of Service, NAS is becoming critical to databases.
	<br />
	NAS has had a long successful history, but the number one issue
	precluding NAS from being widely accepted is the perceived
	performance problems on RDBMSs. The Sun Oracle-NAS project is
	addressing these performance problems, allowing customers to
	successfully use NAS with Oracle. By evaluating other protocols
	and transports including DAFS and RDMA, as well as next
	generation transports such as Infiniband, the Sun Oracle-NAS
	project aims to make NAS a viable alternative to block based/SAN
	storage.
	<br />
	As part of Suns N1 strategy, NAS protocols become a critical
	utility needed for network based computing. It is especially
	important when dealing with blade servers, and virtualized
	compute resources where commercial applications can run on any
