			<td>Brent Welch, Panasas</td>
		</tr>

		<tr><td colspan=2>
	pNFS is a protocol extension that provides direct,
	parallel I/O capabilities to NFSv4. Direct I/O means
	that pNFS clients can access storage devices directly,
	bypassing the NFS server during Read and Write operations.
	Parallel I/O means that a single file can be distributed
	over several storage devices so that a client can access
	a file using concurrent I/O operations. Direct I/O bypasses
	the NFS server so that it can support more clients.
	Parallel I/O means that clients can get more bandwidth
	to a file than a single storage device can deliver.
	Parallel I/O also allows large numbers of clients in
	compute clusters to access many storage devices at once.
	The pNFS extension allows for different storage protocols
	between clients and the storage devices. These include
	traditional block storage devices accessed on a SAN,
	object storage devices accessed via iSCSI, and file
	servers accessed via NFS. This inclusive approach
	supports a goal of having a single NFS client that is
	interoperable with a wide variety of high performance
	file system implementations.

		<tr><td colspan=2>
	Statelessness allowed NFS Versions 2 and 3 servers to export
	shared storage in parallel with ease and opened the door to
	parallel, high-bandwidth, industry standard NAS that scales in
	fine-grained increments.
	<br />
	NFSv4 servers don't have it so easy. They have their own state
	to manage -- like OPEN -- but the protocol does not support
	distributing it among multiple servers, making it difficult to
	export shared storage in parallel.
	<br />
	Yet the aggregate bandwidth demands of modern clustered clients
	surpase even the bandwidth availiable with these multiple
	parallel NFS service systems; as long as access to a single file
	system through the NFS protocol requires access to a single NFS
	server, bandwidth will be limited to the single NFS servers
	resources.
	<br />
	Fortunately, NFSv4 is extensible. Efforts are under way to
	understand the common use cases for parallel access, to shape
	appropriate minor version extensions that overcome the single
	NFS server hardship, to prototype, to measure, and to engineer
	these solutions.
	<br />
	In this talk, I will describe partnerships under way at CITI to
	solve the parallel NFS bugaboo.

	Distributed Hierarchal Storage Management allows customers to
	create filesystems on multiple tiers of storage and
	automatically move file resources from more expensive to less
	expensive storage resources based on user defined policies.
	These policies demote resources to more cost effective storage
	based on access patterns or other business process logic.
	Whatever the policy, the net impact to the customer is the same
	- better, more cost effective, storage utilization without an
	impact on the typical user experience.  Traditional NAS DHSM
