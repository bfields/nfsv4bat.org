	While it has many shortcomings and it has been outmarketed by

	future. This is particularly true given recent developments in
	optical transmission, raw silicon availability and storage
	technology.  With some diligence in implementation and some

	requiring implementation experience before moving a protocol to
	Draft Standard has shown to be prudent in the case of NFS
	version 4 where some protocol issues have been found and

		<tr><td colspan=2>The primary value proposition for the NFS technology has always
	been consolidation of data for shared access and ease of
	management.  Since the inception of NFS there has been a
	constant call for greater performance from the shared storage
	environments.
		<br />
	The outcry from customers requiring greater performance, lead
	us to develop the Network Attached Storage (NAS) appliance.
	These specialized appliances improved the service performance
	significantly.  However, performance was still not satisfactory
	to the latency watching database managers.
		<br />
	This presentation will look at the trade-offs between high
	performance and shared data access.  How far can the industry
	push performance in a shared environment?
	Does it make sense to put latency sensitive applications data
	into a shared environment? Finally, this paper will look at
	tools that would allow customers to understand and control
	their performance in a shared storage environment.
