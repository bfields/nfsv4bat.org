  <h1>CDA</h1>

  <p>
    We do not need an CDA if you plan to just attend a talk. If you plan to be on the testing floor,
    we need a CDA in place - just one per company. Please fill out the
    <a href="/Events/2012/October/BAT/NetApp_BAT_2012_CDA.pdf">CDA (pdf)</a>,
    sign it, scan it, and send me a copy.  You can also just bring it with you.
  </p>
  
  <h1>Talks</h1>

  <p>No talks are scheduled</p>

  <h1>Registration</h1>

   <p>What we need is the number of attendees from your company,
      their names (and email) for badging purposes, and the type of
      equipment you will be bringing.</p>

   <p>We are primarily interested in if the equipment has special
      power requirements and if it is loud.</p>

   <p>If you are interested in reserving some UID, GID, and names in
      NIS/LDAP, please let us know.</p>

   <p>By the way, please look at the <a href="/Documents/Requirements/event_hosting.html">Event Hosting Requirements</a> and let us know if you plan to use
      a network service not listed.</p>
