<h1>Automatic inheritance</h1>

<p>Automatic inheritance is not automatic!  It is performed by the ACL
editor, not the server.

<p>(Think of it as a fancy "chmod -R".)

<p>NFSv4.1 adds two new acl attributes, which support automatic
inheritance:

<ul>
<li>dacl: ALLOW and DENY aces
<li>sacl: AUDIT and ALARM aces
</ul>

<p>Adds a new INHERITED_ACE flag.  ACEs marked with this flag will be
replaced by automatic inheritance.
