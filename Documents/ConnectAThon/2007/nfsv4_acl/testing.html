<h1>Interoperability testing</h1>

CIFS client, NFSv4 client, multiprotocol server.

Some preliminary results:

<ul>
<li>For an ACL with a single EVERYONE@ ACE with various mode-bit
combinations, set from one side, query from the other.  (Works OK.)
<li>Set basic OWNER@, GROUP@, EVERYONE@ ACL, query from both clients.
(Windows translates OWNER@ and GROUP@ to current file owner and group;
otherwise OK.)
<li>Windows Explorer, as expected, sometimes reorders allow and denies.
<li>Test handling of suid, sgid, sticky bits.
<li>Identified some implementation bugs.
</ul>

Questions:

<ul>
<li>More realistic tests?
<li>What do people *need* to work in this situation?
</ul>
