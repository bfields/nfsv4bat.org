<h1>Faking it: step 2: relaxed NFSv4->POSIX mapping</h1>

Requirements:

<ol>
<li>Server should accept (almost) any NFSv4 ACL.
<li>"If a server receives a SETATTR request that it cannot accurately
implement, it should error in the direction of more restricted
access."
</ol>

Algorithm outline:

<ol>
<li>Process the NFSv4 ACL as the file owner, find the minimum
permissions it must grant that owner.
<li>Repeat for each named user.
<li>Repeat for a hypothetical member of the owning group that isn't the file
owner or one of the named users.
<li>Repeat similarly for each named group.
<li>Repeat for a user not the file owner or any named user, and not a
member of the file group or any named group.
<li>Assemble resulting permissions into a POSIX ACL.
</ol>

Result:

<ul>
<li>Simpler code
<li>Reasonable results for simple NFSv4 ACLs
</ul>

Also:

<ul>
<li>Allows transition to full NFSv4 ACL support on the client.
</ul>
