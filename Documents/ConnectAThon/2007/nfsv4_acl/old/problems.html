<h1>POSIX->NFSv4 Mapping Problems</h1>

<ul>
<li>Mapped ACLs are two complex for users to read.</li>
<li>Mapped ACLs are *much* too complex for users to write.</li>
<li>Server error reporting is limited: any mistake results in
EINVAL.</li>
</ul>

<p>The only practical way to edit POSIX-mapped ACLs is with a
POSIX-aware ACL editor.</p>

<p>So much for a common ACL model.</p>

<p>Also:

<ul>
<li>Windows ACL editor doesn't like intermingled ALLOWs and DENYs.
(And who can blame it?)</li>
<li>The mapping is fragile.
</ul>
