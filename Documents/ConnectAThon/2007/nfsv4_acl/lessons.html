<h1>Spec changes</h1>

<ul>
<li>Change this:

	<blockquote>"Some server platforms may provide access control
	functionality that goes beyond the UNIX-style mode attribute,
	but which is not as rich as the NFS ACL model.  So that users
	can take advantage of this more limited functionality, <span
	class="b">the server may indicate that it supports ACLs as long
	as it follows the guidelines for mapping between its ACL model
	and the NFS version 4 ACL model.</span>"</blockquote>

To this:

	<blockquote>"The NFS version 4 ACL model is quite rich. Some
	server platforms may provide access control functionality that
	goes beyond the UNIX-style mode attribute, but which is not as
	rich as the NFS ACL model.  So that users can take advantage of
	this more limited functionality, <span class="b">the server may
	support the acl attribute by mapping between its ACL model and
	the NFS version 4 ACL model.  Such servers SHOULD nevertheless
	accept any NFSv4 ACL, and ensure that the ACL they actually
	store or enforce is at least as strict as the NFSv4 ACL that was
	set."</span></blockquote>


<li>Updated draft-ietf-nfsv4-acl-mapping: now implementation advice
and experience rather than POSIX-over-NFSv4 protocol.
</ul>

Possible future work?:

<ul>
<li>Allow more informative server error-reporting?
<li>Allow less strict ACL enforcement?
<li>Document Windows ACL editor conventions?
<li><a href="testing.html">More testing</a>.
</ul>
