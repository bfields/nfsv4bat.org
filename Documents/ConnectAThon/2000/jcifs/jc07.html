<H1>jCIFS Design Ideas</H1>

These are some ideas that have been discussed on the jCIFS list.  Some are
being implemented, others are still ideas.

<UL>
<LI><DL><DT>Create GUI versions of popular Samba tools.
        <DD>Java supports the GUI development, so we should be able to
            present a &#34;Network Neighborhood&#34;-like display and
            allow queries against the nodes and services listed.
        </DL>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI><DL><DT>Small, single-dialect servers &amp; clients.
        <DD>The idea streamlining the implementation by selecting a single
            SMB dialect for use by smaller systems.  A larger system might
            then proxy connections to servers/clients which do not support
            the selected dialect.
        </DL>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI><DL><DT>Provide a command-line interface tool.
        <DD>Allow administrators to control and query a running client or
            server without interrupting service.
        </DL>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI><DL><DT>Dump converstation traces in a standard format.
        <DD>For protocol analysis and debugging, conversations might be
            copied to a something like tcpdump format so that they can be
            viewed using common tools such as Ethereal.
        </DL>
</UL>
