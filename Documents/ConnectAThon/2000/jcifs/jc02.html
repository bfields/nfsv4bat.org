<H1>jCIFS Goals</H1>

<UL>
<LI>Platform independance.
<LI>Provide small, modular, mix-and-match pieces.
<LI>Provide &#34;parts&#34; for building CIFS-aware tools and applications.
<LI>Document what is learned about CIFS <I>as we learn it</I>.
</UL>

<P>The idea is to make CIFS easier to implement, particularly on smaller
devices including embedded systems.  Breaking the code into objects
facilitates tailoring jCIFS to specific platforms and design goals.

<P>Our efforts at documentation will, hopefully, make it easier for others
to understand the workings of CIFS.

<P>While Samba provides a scalable Unix-based CIFS server, jCIFS aims at
facilitating the development of smaller client systems and low-end,
peer-to-peer servers&nbsp;--&nbsp;similar to the kinds of things found on
commodity desktop OSes.
