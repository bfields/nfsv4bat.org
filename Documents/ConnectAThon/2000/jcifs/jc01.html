<H1>What is jCIFS?</H1>

<P>jCIFS is an Open Source development project with the goal of
implementing the Common Internet File System (CIFS) in the Java language. 

<UL>
<LI>jCIFS code is being released under the GNU General Public License.
<LI>jCIFS is a &#34;spin-off&#34; of Samba, but is a separate project.
<LI>jCIFS is <B><I>not</I></B> a port of Samba to Java.
</UL>

<P>jCIFS was started as a result of architectural discussions between
Andrew Tridgel and another Samba Team member.  It became clear that two
different goals were being discussed and that Samba should not be adapted
to try to meet both.  Something new was needed.
