<H2>Development Overview: NT Domain Control</H2>

<P>Work done by the Samba Team has shown that there is a great deal
involved in providing Domain Controler services.  jCIFS is likely to focus
on NT Domain client functionality unless there is sufficient interest from
a new Team member or corporate partner.

<P>Client functionality includes NT Domain login, pass-through
authentication, etc.  The goal will be to interoperate both with NT and
Samba domain controllers.
