<H2>Development Overview: NBNS Server</H2>

<P>The NBNS (aka. WINS) server is required for NetBIOS over a routed LAN. 
It stores <B>NetBIOS Name to IP Address</B> mappings and responds to
name resolution queries.

<P>NetBIOS Name resoultion is also performed via broadcast on a LAN.  This
does not require an NBNS server.

<P>Implementation of a jCIFS &#34;WINS Proxy&#34; is also a possibility.

<P>&nbsp;

<H2>Development Overview: SMB Server</H2>

<P>Provide SMB file &amp; print services using the SMB protocol.  This is
the cornerstone server piece.  It is, however, linked with CIFS
authentication mechanisms which include NT Domain control. 

<P>&nbsp;

<H2>Development Overview: Browsers &amp; Master Browsers</H2>

<P>In the CIFS service announcement mechanism, machines on a local LAN are
&#34;elected&#34; to store the distributed network services list.  Each
LAN has a Local Master Browser responsible for collecting the service list
and distributing it to backup browsers on the LAN.  The Local Master also
communicates with the Domain Master Browser which is responsible for
collecting the NT Domain-wide list and distributing it back to the LANs.
