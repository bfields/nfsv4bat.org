<H1>jCIFS so far...</H1>

<P>jCIFS is still a small, volunteer effort.  As is typical with Open
Source projects, most of us have other things going on in our lives. 
Thus, coding time is scarce.

<P>However, there is a CVS repository, and code is available.
<UL>
<LI>We have some basic utility code.
<LI>There is SMB client code.
<LI>There is some name service code.
<LI>Preliminary CIFS documentation is on-line with more being developed.
</UL>
