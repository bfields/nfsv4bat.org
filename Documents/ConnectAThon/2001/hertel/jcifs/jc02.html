    <LI>Portability.
    <LI>Modular, mix-and-match pieces.
    <LI>Provide &#34;parts&#34; for building CIFS-aware tools and applications.
    <LI>Document what is learned about CIFS <I>as we learn it</I>.

  <P>Samba provides a scalable Unix-based CIFS server.
  <BR>jCIFS aims at the development of smaller client systems and low-end,
  peer-to-peer servers.

  <P>The idea is to make CIFS easier to implement, particularly on smaller
  devices including embedded systems.
  <BR>Breaking the code into objects makes it easier to tailor jCIFS to
  specific design goals.
