<h1><b><font color=#000080>Issues (continued)</b></font></h1><p>
<ul><li><h2>Conflicts with client side replica options </h2>
<ul><li>How do we reconcile client supplied mount options (such as provided in Solaris and used by the automounter) with the server supplied fs_locations. If there is a conflict, who wins?
<li>Chicken and egg problem - if the server supplies the list of replicas, how does the client know which server to talk to first?
<li>Sub-directories of the root may be replicated, complicating the use of share options (which apply to the root).
<li>If server's filesystem is replicated, is fs_locations mandatory?
